Octocrab is a third party GitHub API client, allowing you to easily build your own GitHub integrations or bots in Rust. Octocrab comes with two primary sets of APIs for communicating with GitHub, a high level strongly typed semantic API, and a lower level HTTP API for extending behaviour. I've contributed a few API's to the project including the [list_stargazers endpoint](https://docs.rs/octocrab/latest/octocrab/repos/struct.RepoHandler.html#method.list_stargazers).
